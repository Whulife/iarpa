This code relies heavily on the [NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/). It has been directly included in this repository (in the `lib_exec/StereoPipeline` folder) for ease of installation.

It also rely on the sample code provided during the contest that can be found in the `installation/installation_scripts` folder.
