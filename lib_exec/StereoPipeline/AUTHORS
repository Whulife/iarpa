The Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) was developed by the Intelligent
Robotics Group (IRG), in the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames
Research Center in Moffett Field, CA. It builds on over ten years of
IRG experience developing surface reconstruction tools for terrestrial
robotic field tests and planetary exploration.
